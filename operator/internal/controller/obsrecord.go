// This file is the boundary between what a reconcile pass observed and what
// Surface 2 exports (ADR-033 decision 3): the only place that TRANSLATES a
// reconcile reading into an obsmetrics type, and the direction is one-way on
// purpose — the controller's own verdict types (localVerdict, dbCSNReadout,
// podPresence) know nothing about metrics, so a rendering decision can never
// leak into a reconcile decision.
//
// Three other files in this package name obsmetrics types without reading one:
// obscollector.go (the Prometheus adapter) and the two controllers, which carry
// a *obsmetrics.Store field and call the functions below. None of them maps a
// reading, which is the duplication this boundary exists to prevent.
//
// Both functions here are pure: they read their arguments and allocate a
// value. No client, no clock, no environment. That is what makes the seam
// testable at all — and it is the whole seam, because everything downstream of
// an obsmetrics.Observation is already covered by obsmetrics' own tests.
//
// Why a mapping layer rather than letting the controllers build observations
// inline: this is where a reading stops being reconcile state and becomes an
// export, and decision 5's rules have to survive the crossing intact. Since
// 2026-10-06 the spread's absence survives it as a POINTER rather than as a
// convention the two sides agree on — this layer copies it and decides
// nothing — so what obsrecord_test.go pins is no longer two statements of one
// rule, but that nothing in the crossing invents, drops or re-derives a
// reading. The per-pod probe is the same story: role and glue are facts only
// this side holds, and losing them here is losing them everywhere.

// clusterObservation maps one SlapdCluster pass into the observation Surface 2
// exports for it: the per-database CSN measurement, and the per-peer discovery
// result.
//
// Identity comes from the cluster object itself — namespace, name, and
// spec.meshRef as the `mesh` label, which is the EMPTY STRING for a standalone
// cluster rather than an omitted or invented value (obsmetrics pins that in
// TestMeshLabelIsPresentAndEmptyForAStandaloneCluster). `site` is deliberately
// not derived here or anywhere: monitoring is site-local (ADR-033 amendment
// 2026-10-09), the Prometheus is the site, and a label only Surface 2 carried
// would silently empty any join on it against Surfaces 1 and 3.
//
// readouts is evaluateLocalConvergence's ReadoutBySuffix, keyed by database
// SUFFIX. databaseNames translates a suffix to the SlapdDatabase name, because
// the `database` label is the name a reader can take back to `kubectl get sd`
// and a suffix is not. A suffix absent from databaseNames falls back to the
// suffix itself: the reading is evidence that was taken, and dropping it over a
// naming gap would hide exactly the 2026-10-06 shape this family exists to
// report (a site that could read none of its own databases). The fallback is
// visibly a DN, so a reader can tell which case they are looking at.
//
// discoveryFailed names the peers whose discovery could not be ASKED this pass,
// mapped to the error that stopped it, and it is a PARAMETER because the fact
// does not survive into status. On that path `discoverRemotePeerProviders`
// returns no providers, so `checkPeerCSNConvergence` finds no addresses and
// overwrites `LastError` with "no remote addresses available" — byte for byte
// what a discovery that RAN and found nothing leaves behind. The two cases
// ADR-033 needs separated are indistinguishable in
// status.externalPeerStatuses by the time this function sees it, and
// `LastError` is additionally overwritten by the CSN verdict on every
// successful peer, so reading it here would call a merely-lagging peer's
// discovery "failed".
//
// The caller holds the error at the one place it exists — the discovery branch
// of the status loop, before anything overwrites it — and nothing else does.
// A nil map means no peer failed discovery.
//
// Peers are read from the SPEC, the STATUS and discoveryFailed together,
// because the three facts live in three places and no two of them answer the
// question. status.externalPeerStatuses cannot say which peers discover at all
// — a discovery peer that resolved to nothing carries an empty
// DiscoveredProviders, byte for byte like a `uri` peer that never discovers —
// and spec.replication.externalPeers is where `discovery` lives (it carries the
// mesh-DERIVED peers too by this point, since applyMeshWiring writes them
// there).
//
// discoveryFailed is the third, and it CANNOT be derived from either of the
// other two. A discovery that failed leaves no providers, so
// checkPeerCSNConvergence finds no addresses and overwrites status.lastError
// with "no remote addresses available" — the same text, byte for byte, that a
// discovery which ran and found nothing leaves behind — and on a healthy peer
// it overwrites lastError with the CSN verdict's. Only the caller holds the
// error at the moment it exists, which is why it is a parameter and not a
// lookup.

	//	                   a result of zero).
	//	discoveryFailed  — whether discovery could be ASKED this pass. The
	//	                   caller holds the error at the moment it exists and
	//	                   nothing else does; see the note below.
	//	status           — how many providers it found, when it ran.
	//
	// JOINED BY INDEX, not by name. ExternalPeers carries no +listMapKey=name
	// and judgeExternalPeers refuses a duplicate siteIndex but not a duplicate
	// name, so two peers may legitimately reach here sharing one — and a
	// name-keyed lookup then serves one peer's provider count for the other,
	// which is a wrong reading rather than a missing one. The status list is
	// rebuilt from this same spec slice in this same order on every pass
	// (Reconcile's external-peer loop), so position is the reliable key.
	//
	// Length-checked anyway: a caller that has not populated status yet gets no
	// provider count rather than a fabricated zero, which is the direction
	// decision 5 asks for whenever the two lists could disagree.
	//
	// discoveryFailed stays keyed by NAME because that is the shape the caller
	// can build (it has `ep` in hand, not an index into a list it is still
	// appending to). Under duplicate names that key collapses and BOTH peers
	// read as failed — absence for a peer that was fine, which is the harmless
	// direction; the duplicate itself then shows up as a duplicate sample in

// databaseObservation maps one SlapdDatabase pass into the observation

// mesh is a parameter rather than something read off sd, because a
// SlapdDatabase has no meshRef at all: under ADR-028 the mesh is the cluster's
// fact and a database reaches it only through clusterRef. The caller has the
// cluster in hand already.
//
// probes are the controller's own per-pod probe results, read-write and
// read-only pods alike, and the mapping is exactly suffixprobe's "positive
// evidence only" contract:
//
//	assessed == false  → Probed false. Nothing is rendered for that pod; the
//	                     probe could not be taken, which is never evidence.
//	present            → Healthy. A glue or a missing entry is `assessed and
//	                     not present`, so it renders 0 — probed, and the answer
//	                     was bad (ADR-025).
//	glued              → Glue, and only under assessed. ADR-025's worse state,
//	                     which never heals: it must not arrive at the surface as
//	                     an ordinary `Healthy: false`, because then its alert
//	                     has to be written for the state that DOES heal.
//	readOnly           → ReadOnly. An RO consumer mid-initial-sync is
//	                     legitimately missing its suffix entry (ADR-025's
//	                     2026-09-14 amendment gave that its own condition
//	                     reason), and the controller is the only layer that
//	                     knows which fleet a pod belongs to. Dropping it here is
//	                     what made the two indistinguishable downstream.
//
// Withheld syncrepl convergence is deliberately NOT mapped here. It is the
